# Simple-Planner
This webapp is to used to practice my html, css, js skills and to create a tool I will use daily to develop a routine of knocking out simple tasks and goals that relate to reading and programming.

HTML & CSS
  My HTML and CSS for this project is very simple, since I am not creating a website with multiple pages and need to follow good SEO practices, I will use divs as containers for each element I need sorta like adding layers to a cake to get what I visually want the website to look like. Inside certain divs I will add buttons I will target using JS. The CSS is very simple, following the rule of threes and structuring everything around the center of the webpage since there won't be a need for a nav bar or anything to navigate to other pages.
